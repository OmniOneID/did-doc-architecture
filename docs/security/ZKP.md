## Introduction

ZKP(Zero-Knowledge Proof)-based Credentials are a technology that enables both privacy protection and trust-based authentication, operating on the Verifiable Credential (VC) model. This document outlines the security features of ZKP Credentials, the threat model, and corresponding security strategies.

## Security Features of ZKP Credentials

ZKP Credentials have the following security properties:

- **Selective Disclosure**  
  Users can selectively prove only required attributes without revealing the entire VC content.

- **Unlinkability**  
  Even if the same credential is presented to multiple verifiers, it is impossible to link the submitted proofs.

- **Non-reusability**  
  The generated proof is designed to be one-time use, preventing reuse attacks.

- **Credential Integrity**  
  ZKP-based proofs ensure that the verifier can validate that the data in the credential has not been tampered with or forged.

- **Holder Control**  
  The user (Prover) has full control over storing and presenting their credentials, minimizing external exposure.

## Threat Model and Mitigation

| Threat                  | Description                                                       | Mitigation Strategy                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential Forgery     | Attempting to issue or present a forged credential                | Verification using CL signature structure, Issuer signature verification |
| Correlation Attack     | Tracking a user through multiple proofs                           | Proof generation using nonces, design of unlinkable proofs |
| Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) | Intercepting data during the proof process                      | Data-in-transit encryption (TLS), signature validation |
| Credential Theft       | Credential theft from user devices                                | Secure storage, use of Android Keystore/TEE          |
| Replay Attack          | Reusing the same proof to attempt authentication                  | Verification requests using nonce and timestamp      |

## Security Considerations

- **Revocation**  
  If necessary, a revocation registry can be introduced to invalidate credentials, but usage must be carefully considered in terms of privacy and performance.

- **Proof Size & Performance**  
  ZKP may have longer proof generation/verification times compared to signature-based VC and must be optimized for resource-constrained environments.

- **Key Management**  
  The key storage methods for Issuer, Holder, and Verifier critically affect system trust. Secure modules like HSM/Keystore are recommended.

- **Credential Binding**  
  A binding strategy (e.g., DID, Holder signature) must be implemented to ensure the credential is tied to a specific user.

## Conclusion

ZKP Credentials provide strong security features in terms of privacy protection and forgery prevention. However, secure operation requires rigorous security policies across the entire lifecycle, from issuance and storage to verification. ZKP-based authentication architecture should be considered an essential component of next-generation trust infrastructure design.
